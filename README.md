Integration and analysis of Eastern New Jersey fish eDNA data with oceanographic variables using machine learning

## Overview

This project integrates environmental DNA (eDNA) data with oceanographic variables to analyze fish community dynamics across different seasons. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques, this research aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced view of fish distribution dynamics prior to construction of offshore wind farms.

### Objectives

**1**: Determine if nonlinear machine learning models outperform linear dimensionality reduction techniques in encoding a 2D representation of the data.  
**2**: Investigate if there exists a significant correlation between observed eDNA-oceanography patterns and seasonality.

## Workflow

Flow chart with workflow will be added upon project completion.

## Code

Keras/Tensorflow is being used for building a simple VAE for dimensionality reduction. The code will be run in Colab and the corresponding Jupyter notebook will be added to the repository at a later date.

## Methods

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compare the effectiveness of nonlinear methods like t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) against linear methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use Random Forests (RF) to analyze the correlation between eDNA-oceanography patterns and seasonality.

## Impact

- **Fisheries Management**: Provide accurate and up-to-date information on fish community compositions and seasonal variations to inform stock assessments and ensure sustainable fisheries.
- **Offshore Wind Development**: Offer insights into the potential impacts of offshore wind farms on marine biodiversity, guiding the placement and operation of wind farms to minimize disruptions.
